The course is offered by Sheela C S, CNI-Research Scholar pursuing Ph.D. under the supervision of Prof. Joy Kuri in the Network Research Lab, Department of Electronic Systems Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India.

This beginner-friendly course introduces and explores the MATLAB WLAN Toolbox of MathWorks. It covers the conceptual study and discussion of eight simulation experiments derived from her initial research work on IEEE 802.11ax WLANs.  

- Experiment 1 : IEEE WLAN 802.11ax Channel Model
- Experiment 2 : Channel Frequency Response of Indoor channel models
- Experiment 3 : IEEE WLAN 802.11ax PHY frame format  
- Experiment 4 : Estimation of channel frequency response in an 802.11ax SISO-OFDM channel
- Experiment 5 : Dynamic rate control simulation in 802.11ac channel
- Experiment 6 : Auto Rate Fallback (ARF) rate control algorithm in 802.11ax channel  
- Experiment 7 : Adaptive ARF (AARF) rate control algorithm in 802.11ax channel
- Experiment 8 : HE- MU transmit packet power analysis for different MCS combinations and RU size

Each experiment includes a learning objective, an explanation of essential technical concepts, a detailed walkthrough of the MATLAB code, and an analysis of the simulation results. This course aims to support students and researchers who are new to WLAN technology or the MATLAB WLAN Toolbox. It provides a smooth introduction, enabling learners to start using the WLAN Toolbox with ease.  

The course content and codes are available in CNI’s GitHub repository [https://github.com/cni-iisc/wlan-module](https://github.com/cni-iisc/wlan-module).

Video recordings for each experiment are uploaded under [this playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNN9TCnjABcYHR9XRiQitBCHJUeT_58QG&si=iQvBKUVCtirMGizj) on CNI’s YouTube channel.
