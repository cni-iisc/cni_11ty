Topic_abstract: "The problem of group testing entails inferring a subset of defective items from a (much larger) population, using as few 'pooled tests' as possible. Each pooled test specifies a subset of the items and produces a binary outcome: 'negative' if all the items selected in the test are non-defective, and 'positive' otherwise. While the original motivation for group testing was medical testing, it has since found application across a wide variety of scenarios including wireless communications, DNA sequencing, neighbour discovery, and network tomography. We review some of the main results in group testing and then introduce a new variation of the problem ('cascaded group testing') where each test is specified by an ordered subset of items, and returns the first defective item in the specified order."
