Topic_abstract: New network architectures, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G, and next-generation (NextG) cellular systems, present emerging challenges in the design of future wireless networks. These networks need to accommodate ultra-high data rates, massive data processing, smart designs, cost-effective deployment, and ensure reliability and security in dynamic environments. Artificial Intelligence (AI), one of todayâ€™s most promising technologies, is being explored as a key enabler of data-driven approaches to wireless network design. This presentation provides a comprehensive review of existing AI techniques and their applications across the entire wireless network protocol stack, aiming to enhance both network performance and security. We will examine the motivations, challenges, and methodologies involved in leveraging AI to improve wireless networking, from the physical layer to the application layer, while also identifying opportunities for developing new AI-driven algorithms, mechanisms, protocols, and system designs that will define the future of data-driven wireless networks.
